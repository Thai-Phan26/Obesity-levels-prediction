# Obesity-levels-prediction
Prediction of Obesity Levels in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia

This project is a part of my Master of Analytics program at RMIT. I worked in a group with three members for this project, the other two members are credited in the report. This report employed the Obesity Levels dataset from Kaggle (Mehrparvar, 2024). It is a continuation of the visualisation project that I have already posted. This report aims to predict obesity levels in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia using a variety of models such as KNN, Gaussian NB, Decision Tree, and Random Forrest.
